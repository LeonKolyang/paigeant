# Paigeant

**Durable workflow orchestration for AI agents in distributed systems**

*Transform fragile agent call chains into resilient, production-ready workflows*

---

## What is Paigeant?

Paigeant is a Python library that provides the messaging infrastructure to orchestrate AI agents across distributed services. It solves the fundamental problem of building resilient, multi-agent workflows that can survive crashes, network failures, and deployments without losing work or state.

**The Problem**: Chaining AI agents together with direct calls creates a "distributed monolith" - if any agent crashes, the entire workflow fails catastrophically.

**The Solution**: Paigeant transforms fragile call chains into durable, message-driven workflows where each step is independent, recoverable, and can resume exactly where it left off.

```
❌ Fragile: Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Agent D (crashes cascade)
✅ Resilient: Agent A → Queue → Agent B → Queue → Agent C → Queue → Agent D
```

## Core Principles

Paigeant is built on three foundational architectural principles:

1. **🔄 Asynchronous-First Communication** - All inter-agent communication is async by default, eliminating blocking calls and cascade failures
2. **💾 Durable Execution** - Workflows survive crashes because state lives in messages, not memory
3. **🔒 Zero-Trust Messaging** - Built-in security with OAuth delegation and cryptographic message integrity

## What You Can Build

### Real-World Use Cases

**Customer Onboarding Pipeline**
```python
onboarding_workflow = [
    "validate-customer-data",
    "create-customer-account", 
    "setup-payment-method",
    "send-welcome-email"
]
```
If payment processing fails, the workflow holds state and retries with backup methods - no lost progress.

**E-commerce Order Processing**
```python
order_workflow = [
    "validate-order",
    "check-inventory", 
    "process-payment",
    "update-inventory",
    "generate-shipping-label",
    "send-confirmation"
]
```
Each step can be handled by specialized AI agents, with automatic retry and recovery.

**Support Ticket Automation**
```python
support_workflow = [
    "classify-ticket-priority",
    "route-to-specialist",
    "research-customer-history", 
    "generate-response",
    "schedule-follow-up"
]
```
Sophisticated AI analysis at each step, with human handoff capabilities.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Paigeant

```bash
uv add paigeant
```

### 2. Define Your Workflow

Think of your business process as independent steps:

```python
from paigeant import ActivitySpec

onboarding_steps = [
    ActivitySpec(name="validate-customer-data"),
    ActivitySpec(name="create-customer-account"),
    ActivitySpec(name="setup-payment-method"),
    ActivitySpec(name="send-welcome-email"),
]
```

### 3. Dispatch the Workflow

```python
import asyncio
from paigeant import WorkflowDispatcher, get_transport

async def main():
    transport = get_transport()
    await transport.connect()
    
    dispatcher = WorkflowDispatcher(transport)
    
    correlation_id = await dispatcher.dispatch_workflow(
        activities=onboarding_steps,
        variables={
            "customer_email": "new.customer@example.com",
            "subscription_tier": "premium"
        }
    )
    
    print(f"Workflow dispatched: {correlation_id}")
    await transport.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### 4. Build Workers for Each Step

Each activity gets handled by a dedicated service:

```python
# Worker service handling "validate-customer-data" messages
async def handle_validation(message):
    customer_email = message.payload["customer_email"]
    
    # Use your existing agents/logic here
    is_valid = await customer_validator_agent.validate(customer_email)
    
    if is_valid:
        # Mark complete and continue workflow
        message.routing_slip.mark_complete("validate-customer-data")
        await transport.publish("workflows", message)
    else:
        # Handle validation failure with custom logic
        await handle_validation_error(message)
```

## AI Agent Integration

### With pydantic-ai

Paigeant includes built-in integration for pydantic-ai agents:

```python
from paigeant import create_planner_agent, PlannerAgentDeps

# Create an AI agent that can dispatch workflows
agent = create_planner_agent(model="openai:gpt-4")

# Give it workflow dispatch capabilities
deps = PlannerAgentDeps(
    workflow_dispatcher=dispatcher,
    user_obo_token="user-session-token"
)

# Agent creates workflows from natural language
result = await agent.run(
    "I need to onboard a new premium customer: john@example.com",
    deps=deps
)
```

The AI agent automatically:
1. Understands the request
2. Creates appropriate workflow activities  
3. Dispatches the workflow
4. Returns a tracking ID

### Agents as Workflow Steps

Each workflow step can use sophisticated AI internally:

```python
async def handle_support_ticket(message):
    ticket_data = message.payload
    
    # Use AI agent for analysis
    support_agent = Agent(model="openai:gpt-4")
    analysis = await support_agent.run(
        f"Analyze this support ticket: {ticket_data}"
    )
    
    # Continue workflow with analysis
    message.payload["analysis"] = analysis.data
    message.routing_slip.mark_complete("analyze-ticket")
    await transport.publish("workflows", message)
```

## How It Works: Technical Architecture

### The Routing Slip Pattern

Every workflow message carries its own "itinerary" - a routing slip that tracks:

- **Activities to complete**: The workflow's task list
- **Completed activities**: What's been done
- **Payload data**: Information flowing through the workflow
- **Security context**: User permissions and message integrity

```python
# Example message structure
{
    "correlation_id": "uuid-here",
    "routing_slip": {
        "itinerary": ["validate", "create", "notify"],
        "completed": ["validate"],
        "current": "create"
    },
    "payload": {
        "customer_email": "user@example.com",
        "subscription_tier": "premium"
    },
    "security": {
        "obo_token": "oauth-token",
        "jws_signature": "cryptographic-signature"
    }
}
```

### Federated Architecture

Paigeant follows a clean separation of concerns:

- **Task Layer** (pydantic-ai): In-process agent execution and reasoning
- **Workflow Layer** (paigeant): Cross-service message orchestration

This federated approach means:
- No centralized orchestrator (eliminating single points of failure)
- Each service owns its business logic
- Workflow state travels with the message
- Easy to scale and deploy independently

### Transport Abstraction

Paigeant works with any message broker:

```python
# Development
export PAIGEANT_TRANSPORT=inmemory

# Production options  
export PAIGEANT_TRANSPORT=rabbitmq
export PAIGEANT_TRANSPORT=redis
```

You can switch transports without changing workflow code, enabling:
- **Local development** with in-memory queues
- **Production deployment** with enterprise message brokers
- **Hybrid architectures** mixing different transports

## Key Benefits

## Getting Started Guide

1. **Think in workflows**: Break your business process into independent steps
2. **Start small**: Begin with 2-3 steps to understand the pattern  
3. **Add durability gradually**: Start with in-memory transport, upgrade to production brokers
4. **Monitor and observe**: Use correlation IDs to track workflow progress
5. **Scale up**: Add more complex workflows as your confidence grows
